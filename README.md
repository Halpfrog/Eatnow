Motivation 

When you want to order food online, it is a hassle to figure out which food delivery service gives you the best deal. Having to sift through multiple applications in search of the cheapest option can be troublesome, especially with surge pricing causing prices of food delivery services to be inconsistent.

Many of us have simply gone with the first option we find simply to avoid the hassle of using multiple applications and we hope to change this by giving consumers a way to get the best bang for their buck in the shortest time possible. 

Aim 

We hope to make the comparison between ordering services easier with the use of a simple website that will link you to the cheapest delivery option.
